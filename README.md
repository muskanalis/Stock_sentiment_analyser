# Stock_sentiment_analyser
The stock market reacts not just to numbers but also to how people feel about a company. If you’re an individual investor or just curious, you can use a sentiment analyzer to get a quick pulse on how people feel about your favorite stocks.

# Why & Where & When & Who & Purpose & AI (Keepin’ It Real)

why use this project?
because the stock market isn’t just numbers — it’s feelings, news, and vibes all mixed up. this tool helps you quickly understand if the buzz around a stock is mostly good, bad, or meh — saving time and helping you make smarter choices.

where can you use it?
anywhere you want to get the real vibe on stock news — at home, in your dorm, for a school project, or even if you wanna impress on your first job. investors, traders, or just curious folks can all use it to catch the mood fast.

when should you use it?
when there’s a flood of news and you’re drowning in headlines. instead of scrolling forever, this tool sums it up in seconds — perfect for those hectic market days when quick info is gold.

how many people can use it?
any number! it’s a simple, open project. you, your friends, classmates, or even an entire small team could use and improve it together.

what purpose does it serve?
it turns messy text — like tweets or news — into clear, easy-to-understand sentiment scores. this helps you spot good news, bad news, or neutral vibes around stocks so you don’t miss a beat.

how is this different from “AI”? does it really need AI?
fun fact: this project uses basic natural language processing, which is like a simple AI. but it doesn’t need complex deep learning or huge data sets to work. sometimes, simpler = better. it’s faster, easier to understand, and still gets the job done without fancy AI tricks. so yeah, it’s kinda low-key genius that way.
